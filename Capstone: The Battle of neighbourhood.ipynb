Murders in the city peaked in 1974, with 970 murders when the city's population was over three million, resulting in a murder rate of around 29 per 100,000, and again in 1992, with 943 murders when the city had fewer than three million people, resulting in a murder rate of 34 murders per 100,000 citizen. Chicago reduced a murder rate in 2018. The municipal authorities want to keep this trend. They outsourced to prepare a report which is to identify crime patterns in Chicago.\nThe report should provide answers for below questions including difference between overall crimes and homicides:\n- When crimes are committed? \n\n- Which community areas are the most dangerous? (crimes per 1000 inhabitants)\n\n- Are police departments properly located? (Foursquare location)"
